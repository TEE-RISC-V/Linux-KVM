Linux Trusted Execution Environment
===================================

This is a fork of the Linux kernel with modifications to support a Trusted
Execution Environment (TEE) based on the RISC-V architecture. The TEE is
implemented as layer of software running below the hypervisor in M-mode. 

The TEE is responsible for securely performing page table management and
interrupt handling. The TEE is also responsible for securely loading the
hypervisor and guest kernels into memory. The M-mode firmware is implemented
as a modified version of the OpenSBI firmware located [here](https://github.com/TEE-RISC-V/OpenSBI).


Branch Description
==================

- **master** : This is the branch containing the hypervisor host kernel, most of the
modifications are done in this branch.  
- **guest**  : This is the guest kernel branch, it is largely unmodified from the
upstream kernel.


Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
